    1. "1957 Victim Names Dictionary" since 2000 began to collect, edit, due to the
continuous evolution of editing ideas, tailoring methods, but also due to the lack of
time and resources, so more than ten years of style, format, arrangement, inevitably
there are inconsistent situations, errors, omissions, and even irregularities, these
readers are more critical and corrected, and gradually corrected and overcome.
    2. The project has received the care and guidance of experts and scholars such
as Professor Ding Shu; the help of teachers of the China Research Service Center of
the University of Chinese of Hong Kong and colleagues of the Wuqi Society; and the
support of the victims and their descendants in providing historical materials and
memoirs in 1957.
    3. Professor Song Yongyi's "Database of China's Anti-Rightist Movement 1957-",
the "Internal Reference" collected by the China Research Service Center of the
University of Chinese of Hong Kong, the relevant newspaper books, the "Traces of
the Past" edited and published by Tieliu and the Old Man of Beijing May 7, and
Professor Guo Dehong's "Chronicle of the "Anti-Rightist Movement" (book
manuscript), etc., are of great help to this project. The China Research Service Center
also provides technical support.
    4. In 2019, the 1957 Great Dictionary of Victim Names was funded by the
American Labor Reform Research Foundation to publish a database version.
    I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the Laogai Research Foundation
and colleagues, all relevant scholars, teachers, friends and volunteers! And please
continue to help, support!
