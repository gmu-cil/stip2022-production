Many of the victims of this movement were “early advocates of free-market reforms” and also many were chosen based off of participation during a prior campaign to this movement; the Hundred Flowers Campaign (factsanddetails.com, 2016). During the Hundred Flower Campaign (1956-1957), the Communist Party chairman, Mao Zedong, encouraged the citizens of China to speak up about the CCP in a controversial light and allowed “criticism of the government” (factsanddetails.com, 2016). Mao proposed the “idea o 'letting a hundred flowers bloom' in the arts and 'a hundred schools of thought contend' in the sciences\" (factsanddetails.com, 2016). After receiving an overwhelming amount of criticism towards the CCP, Mao turned to punishing those who spoke out claiming it was due to their disloyalty to the CCP which caused disunity in their country, thus starting the \"Rightist\" movement. Although the \"Rightist\" Movement itself only lasted two years, the number of deaths has never been entirely confirmed and many who survived were imprisoned in labor camps years after the movement ended. This database is dedicated to educating the public about this movement and promoting human rights and social justice by showing the \"rightists\" who were victims of it.",
