    "overview_body": "The purpose of this project was to build a web-based digital archive based on the collection of documents, testimonials, biography, and images of Chinese intellectuals who were accused of being against the government during the Chinese Anti-Rightist Movement from 1957 to 1959. While our research project contains over 40,000 files of structured and unstructured Chinese data, it’s only a small portion of the millions of lives that were affected by this campaign. Furthermore, this archival collection focuses on making the “Rightist” collection accessible and searchable to the public by utilizing computational archival science (CAS) methods and design methodology from the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).",
    "research_found": "Research and what we found",
    "research_body": "After the development team translated and data fetch the Chinese data of more than 40,000 “Rightist” documents, our team found that the data focuses on the demographics of the people that were labeled as Rightists. Although the documents collectively reveal “unknown” fields, the notable variables that contain the most information are under the 'Gender' and 'Year of becoming a Rightist' attributes with 39,949 records generated.",
    "data1": "Year someone became a “Rightist”",
    "data2": "Gender",
    "data1_body": "Based on the data extracted, this bar graph illustrates the number of labeled “Rightists” during the Anti-Rightist Movement between the years 1957 and 1959. There is also an additional field for those with no information labeled as unknown. While there are 27.84% of unknown values of 1,121 individuals, most Chinese intellectuals were labeled as “Rightists” at the start of the movement in 1957 with 67.14% of 26,823 individuals. In comparison to1959, only 0.19% of 76 individuals were marked as Rightists. This data will be combined with real-time updates of new contributed files made by account users in the indefinite future.",
    "data2_body": "According to the 39,949 records we have data fetched for the Gender attribute, 29.02% of 11,595 individuals were male while 3.33% of 1,329 individuals were female. There are 67.65% unknown values for the 27,025 individuals that were left undetermined. From the pie chart, it is likely that many of the 'unknown' Rightists could potentially be male due to the high value of males compared to females. This data will be combined with real-time updates of new contributed files made by account users in the indefinite future.",
    "summary": "Summary",
    "summary_body": "Overall, the data from the large-scale curation and archival collection is still a work in progress. The current completed data, however, demonstrates that there are more males documented during the movement than females who were identified as “Rightists” by the Chinese Communist Party. Moreover, our dataset contains more output information about Chinese intellectuals at the start of the movement than at the end.",

    "home_history_body": "The Anti-“Rightist” Movement was a two year period in China (1957-1959) where the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) reeducated, humiliated, imprisoned, and executed those who were counter-revolutionaries. Many of the \"rightists\" in this movement were “early advocates of free-market reforms” and also many were chosen based off of participation during a prior campaign to this movement; the Hundred Flowers Campaign (factsanddetails.com, 2016). During the Hundred Flowers Campaign (1956-1957), the Communist Party chairman, Mao Zedong, encouraged the citizens of China to speak up about the CCP in a controversial light and allowed “criticism of the government” (factsanddetails.com, 2016). Mao proposed the “idea of ‘letting a hundred flowers bloom’ in the arts and ‘a hundred schools of thought contend’ in the sciences\" (factsanddetails.com, 2016). After receiving an overwhelming amount of criticism towards the CCP, Mao turned to punishing those who spoke out claiming it was due to their disloyalty to the CCP which caused disunity in their country, thus starting the Anti-\"Rightist\" movement. Although the Anti-\"Rightist\" Movement itself only lasted two years, the number of deaths has never been entirely confirmed and many who survived were imprisoned in labor camps years after the movement ended. This database is dedicated to educating the public about this movement and promoting human rights and social justice by showing the \"rightists\" who were involved with it. Reference:     (2016). HUNDRED FLOWERS CAMPAIGN AND THE ANTI-RIGHTIST MOVEMENT. Retrieved 2022, from https://factsanddetails.com/china/cat2/sub6/item1153.html. ",

    "about_movement_introduction_body": "During the Hundred Flowers Campaign (1956-1957), the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) chairman, Mao Zedong, encouraged the citizens of China to speak up about the CCP in a controversial light and allowed “criticism of the government” from anyone (factsanddetails.com, 2016). Mao proposed the “idea of ‘letting a hundred flowers bloom’ in the arts and ‘a hundred schools of thought contend’ in the sciences' (factsanddetails.com, 2016). Although the Chinese people were encouraged to write and express their opinions about the government, they were reluctant to speak up for months. Eventually, people began to give feedback. However, this feedback largely became viewed as criticism towards Mao and the CCP. In fact, there became such an overwhelming amount of criticism received by and about the CCP, Mao turned to punishing those who spoke out, claiming it was due to their disloyalty to the CCP which caused disunity in their country. This reversal in acceptance of feedback thus began the Anti-“Rightist” Movement.",
    "about_movement_introduction_body2": "Those who had spoken up during the Hundred Flowers Campaign between 1956-1957, became labeled as intellectuals or “rightists” and were considered counter-revolutionaries according to the CCP. Some intellectuals included teachers, professors, journalists, artists, writers, and even doctors. After being labeled a rightist many of these people were reeducated, humiliated, imprisoned, or executed during the Anti- “Rightist” Movement, which lasted from 1957-1959. After the movement ended in 1959, many “rightists” were still affected years after, some of which were in labor camps up to 22 years after the movement had ended (factsanddeatils.com, 2016).",
